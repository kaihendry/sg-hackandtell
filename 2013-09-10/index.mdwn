# Hack and Tell, 2013-09-10

Dude, it was *awesome*, you totally missed out:

  - [Kai Hendry](http://hendry.iki.fi) described how he and [Adnan
    Jaludin](http://code.google.com/u/104517877938669365758) rigged up
    a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to log the temperature of the
    Hackerspace. There are [graphs](http://stats.webconverger.org/pihsg/temp/google.html)! 
    There is also [code](https://github.com/kaihendry/rpitemp). 

  - [Yours Truly](http://vikramverma.com) demoed a tiny parser he wrote to load
    Kindle clipping files into [Mnemosyne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/),
    so he doesn't forget specifics of the books he reads.

  - [Ted Chen](http://sg.linkedin.com/in/chiuhaochen) described an audio
    steganography project; he and his team embedded a VLF beacon into a music
    file. Kind of like how Lucius Fox mapped Gotham in [The Dark Knight
    (2008)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/)?!?!  An earlier demo is
    [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDCOjgkPfaU).

  - [Melvin Zhang](http://melvinzhang.net/) talked about a collection of
    AI programs he's developed to play [Magic: The Gathering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering). 
    You should check out [Magarena](https://code.google.com/p/magarena/).

  - [Shaun Martin](http://www.appliedcognitivescience.com/) walked
    through two very different programs to print the Fibonnaci sequence
    in Haskell. Stuff's mind-blowing.

  - [Chinmay Pendharkar](http://chinpen.net/) gave us a brief
    introduction to the Web Audio API. His complete slides are
    [here](http://notthetup.github.io/webaudioslides/), but we only had time
    for a compressed version of that.

  - [Lim Chee Aun](http://cheeaun.com/) returned to give us a progress
    report on his [Bus Route Explorer](http://cheeaun.github.io/busrouter-sg/), 
    a web application to view the routes of Singapore's bus services. You
    should play with it, it is the best thing.

  - [Phil Mockridge](http://squashpassion.com/) explained that his customers
    can pay for lessons with [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/), which is pretty
    cool I guess?!?

There's always next time..
